# Workloop

**Workloop** is a freelance marketplace platform (similar to Fiverr / Upwork), built in PHP + MySQL, which lets freelancers offer services and clients browse, request, and manage services — with separate dashboards for freelancers, clients, and an admin panel.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Freelancers can register, create service listings, upload images/files, and manage their services.  
- Clients can sign up, browse services, request a service, and manage orders.  
- An admin panel handles user management, services/products/blogs moderation, analytics, and platform oversight.  
- The UI is inspired by modern freelance marketplaces — responsive, intuitive, and easy to navigate.
